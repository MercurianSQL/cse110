Purpose: Practicing with list indexes.


# First prepare the list, just like the previous checkpoint
print("Please enter the items of the shopping list (type: quit to finish):")

    if item != "quit":

# We now have the list. Print it out to verify:
print("\nThe shopping list is:")

    print(item)

print("\nThe shopping list with indexes is:")

    # I could have just put shopping_list[i] directly in my print statement
    # rather than creating a separate variable if I wanted. I decided to do it
    # this way to make it easier to read.
